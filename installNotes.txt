# Since there may be personal and medical information communicated through 
# this server, it's recommended to also install SSL.
# Use the apache documentation to install it. In short it comes down to:
# make sure you have a certificate from a certificate authority (costs 
# involved but recommended) or sign-it yourself (free, not recommended).
## Install your certificate.
## Enable ssl:
# a2ensite default-ssl.conf
## Configure it:
# vi /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default-ssl.conf
## restart Apache to make the change effective
# service apache2 restart
